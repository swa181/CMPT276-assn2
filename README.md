## Sorting

Can sort students (by ascending order) based on:

- Name (sorts by both first and last name)
- Weight
- Height

## Circles and Rectangles

Each student is represented by a circle and a rectangle.

The circle represents their head. Each circle is colored with respect to the hair color of the student.

The rectangles represent their body with repect to their proportions as represented by their weight and height. The color of the rectangles are representative of their gender: red for female, blue for male and gold for other.


## The Hoverable Student

Each student has a hoverable tool tip.
The tool tip displays the Full Name, Student ID, and GPA.


## Easy Student-Editing

Users are able to use the easy drop-down menu to alter a chosen student information. Once a student is selected from the dropdown, the "Edit a student" input fields are prepopulated with the current values of that particular student.

A helpful alert warns attempts to delete a student from the window stating that your requests are irreversible. This notification prevents accidental deletions.
